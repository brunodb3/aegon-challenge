# AegonChallenge

## Welcome stranger!

This challenge was provided by some of the greatest minds of Aegon developers, and your task here is to find errors/anti-patterns on this code. You should describe what these are, and how would you improve them. Oh, and there's a bug in the code! Find it, and fix it!

After you're done, send your findings to us via the contact person that gave you this.
