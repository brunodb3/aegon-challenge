# AegonChallenge

## Welcome stranger!

This challenge was provided by some of the greatest minds of Aegon developers, and your task here is to find errors/anti-patterns on this code. You should describe what these are, and how would you improve them.

After you're done, send your findings to us via the contact person that gave you this.
